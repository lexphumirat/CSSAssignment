command /  to comment things out in css
Inline elements: <a>, <img>, <span>, <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>
Block elements: <body>, <div>, <form>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <table>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>

Margin is outside block elements, while padding is within them.
This means that we use margin to separate a block from things around it, and padding to move a block's content away from its edges.

(The order flows clockwise, top -> right -> bottom -> left.)

Html used to link css stylesheets
